<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Francisco Zamora, I'm a 32 year old man looking forward on learning new <br>
  skills that are highly required nowadays, by subscribing to Udemy and buying Angela's<br>
  web development bootcamp, wich as far as I've go, I think it was an excellent choice,<br>
  I took my first step on becoming a better professional by doing this, since I've been<br>
  postponing this matter too many times, and gave it more thought that I should.</p>

<p>I'm currently studying software engeneering at a Catholic University of Costa Rica,<br>
  but I wanted to keep my focus on my goal, so I decided to also learn<br>
  by myself, and with this, to help me have a better chance at finding a<br>
  better job opportunity with more skills at hand.</p>
